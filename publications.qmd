[[**Scaling up PrEP: evidence from a policy to prevent HIV in Brazil**]{.underline}](https://bibliotecadigital.fgv.br/dspace/handle/10438/32015)

PrEP is a drug that is available in many countries and, if taken frequently, can virtually eliminate the risk of being infected with HIV through sex. However, by reducing the cost of unsafe sex, it might promote risky behavior, increasing the incidence of sexually transmitted infections in a typical moral hazard problem. I analyze the effect of PrEP distribution for free in the public health system in Brazil. I find that PrEP is mainly distributed to high-risk individuals. In a difference-in-differences setting exploring temporal variability in the adoption of the policy by municipalities, I find that PrEP reduced by 7.8% the rate of new cases of HIV. The effect is higher for the groups of men who have sex with men, people aged between 25 to 39 years and people who completed high school. These are the main characteristics of PrEP takers. Additionally, there was no substantial effect on syphilis, while it has helped to reduce new cases of hepatitis. Evidence suggests that this is consistent with better screening of individuals and well targeting of the policy.
